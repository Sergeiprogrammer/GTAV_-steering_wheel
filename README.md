# GTAV_-steering_wheel
## My project is: steering wheel emulator for a lot of games like GTA, MAFIA, Cyberpunk, Far Cry and each other

# *how use?* 
## programm have 4 files: 
## [main.py](https://github.com/Sergeiprogrammer/GTAV_-steering_wheel?tab=readme-ov-file#other-file-criticall-need-and-he-in-all-situation-must-be-installed),
## [main_no_gamepad.py](https://github.com/Sergeiprogrammer/GTAV_-steering_wheel?tab=readme-ov-file#main_no_gamepadpy-1), 
## OTHER FILE CRITICALL NEED AND HE IN ALL SITUATION MUST BE INSTALLED

# Selecting files
## check supporting your game gamepad or no?
### there are 3 solutions 1 start programm main.py go to steam librray of this game and steam auto say you support game gemapad also 2 you can cheak in game settings but if it hard for you, 3 just search on gogle :)

# main.py
## who may select this file?
### if you're game have support of gamepad

# main_no_gamepad.py
## who may select this file?
### if you're game have *no* support of gamepad

# setup programm
## firt [install python](https://youtu.be/nU2Egc3Zx3Q?si=UKn9doIC49yTroGD)
## second install librarys start programm "install_all" (if you have any problems find and read the Bugs title)
## third selcet your language and input 1 (calibrate of your wheel)
## fourth if you do all last task start file main.py or main_no_gamepad.py input 2 start game (my programm fork with legal ilegall steam epigames all games!) and enjoy :)

# for those who are interested in the working principle
